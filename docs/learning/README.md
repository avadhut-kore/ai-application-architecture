# Enterprise AI Architecture: Hands-On Learning Curriculum

Welcome to the hands-on learning curriculum for **`ai-application-architecture`**.

This repository is simultaneously:
1. An **Enterprise AI Reference Architecture** establishing architectural patterns, taxonomy, and boundary governance.
2. A **Production-Grade Reference Implementation Monorepo** delivering verifiable code, hermetic test suites, and quantitative AI evaluation harnesses.
3. A **Structured Hands-On Learning Curriculum** designed to guide engineers, solution architects, and technical leaders from foundational governance through advanced enterprise AI patterns.

## 1. Learning Philosophy & Pedagogical Approach

Most AI tutorials teach prompt scripting, single-vendor SDK usage, or ungrounded toy demos. This curriculum teaches **Enterprise AI Architecture**—the discipline of building reliable, observable, secure, and provider-neutral AI capabilities integrated into production software systems.

Every guide in this curriculum follows the strict principle:

> **Repository → Evidence → Explanation**  
> Every architectural concept is grounded in actual committed code, deterministic tests, quantitative evaluations, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Nothing is speculative or imagined.

### The 8-Step Study Method

When studying each phase, progress through this exact sequence:
1. **WHY**: Understand the enterprise problem that necessitated this phase.
2. **WHAT**: Review the architectural decisions and rejected alternatives (ADRs).
3. **WHERE**: Navigate the physical repository structure and component boundaries.
4. **HOW**: Follow the code execution path and dependency directions.
5. **RUN IT**: Execute hermetic test suites and standalone verification tools.
6. **BREAK IT SAFELY**: Induce controlled failures (timeouts, schema violations, service outages) to observe recovery and error classification.
7. **OBSERVE IT**: Inspect latency distributions, token usage metrics, and trace contexts.
8. **EXPLAIN IT**: Defend the architecture using the Architect Interview Checkpoints.

## 2. Curriculum Roadmap & Progression

The curriculum is structured around the repository's phased engineering roadmap. Detailed learning guides are produced **only after a phase has been independently reviewed, accepted, and frozen**.

```
FOUNDATION (PHASES 0–3) — FROZEN & VERIFIED

## 5. Post-Freeze Learning Maintenance Rule

To ensure documentation remains an authoritative educational asset:
> **Post-Freeze Learning Rule**: Whenever a roadmap phase achieves independent acceptance and is frozen, its dedicated learning guide must be authored directly from the verified repository state before work begins on the subsequent phase.
